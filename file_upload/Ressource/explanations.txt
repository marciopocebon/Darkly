On the page http://192.168.56.102/?page=upload we aim to upload a different kind of file than what is demanded/

we want to send whatever we want on the server.
Inspecting the page we find a MAX_FILE_SIZE that we can modify.
We created a script to craft a custom request to send the file : upload.py

How to secure :
- check on server side the magic number and the size.
- do not execute anything coming from users
