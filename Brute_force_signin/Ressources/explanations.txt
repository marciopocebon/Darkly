We did not find a sql injection possibility on the page http://192.168.56.102/?page=signin

Therefore we decide to bruteforce the signin page.

We use the login 'Admin' or 'Root' because they are the most common.

We a bruteforce script : password_brute_force.py that takes a list of most used password called john.txt that we found
here : https://wiki.skullsecurity.org/Passwords

To secure this it is possible to :
- implement limitation on the number of request possible by an ip and then block it
- use custom password
