We know that the pages are generated throught the url arg 'page=...'.
We can guess that the server use it to call the page with that name and include the page into 'index.php'.
So we try to play by adding '../' to watch if we can find some content of the server.
We get a special popup with a different message than the others make us think that we have some to do with this technic.
We add mulitple '../' and 'etc/passwd' at the end which contains informations about the users.
We get the flag.


How to prevent:
	- replace '../' by ''.
	- relace the NULL_BYTE by '';
	- force the '.php' (the fiel has to be include without the extension and we add manually the extension on the server side).
	- include the filename directly in the script and test the url with a name associated.
	- create an dico : key represent the name of the page and th value the filename. If the key exists, include the associated file.
