On the page http://192.168.56.101/index.php?page=recover we inspect tht html.

We can find a form with a post method and an input with it's type equal to hidden

They are different way to work around :

- changing the html code : deleting hidden with the navigator tools. A field shows
and we put a random value (or our email) then submit

- sending a curl request through a terminal :
curl -d "Submit=Submit&mail=autre" -X POST http://192.168.56.101/index.php\?page\=recover

how to secure :
- do not send on a hidden field the email for the account
