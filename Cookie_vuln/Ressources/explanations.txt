Whith a cookie inspector, in this case chrome extension 'Edit this cookie',
it is possible to see that a cookie is set by the website :

I_am_admin=68934a3e9455fa72420237eb05902327

it is a md5 hash which digest is 'false'.
With the cookie editor we change it to 'true' : b326b5062b2f0e69046810717534cb09
After refresh, an alert pops the flag

how to secure :
- do not put critical information in cookies, or crypt it very well (be careful with serialization too)
